# Sandkings

A web-based survival game inspired by George R.R. Martin's "Sandkings" short story. Watch four insectoid colonies grow, compete for resources, and battle each other in a sealed tank environment.

## Features

### Interactive Tools
- **✋ Hand** - Poke and disturb sandkings (they don't like it!)
- **👊 Grab** - Click and drag to pick up individual sandkings and move them around the tank
- **🍖 Scraps** - Drag to drop basic table scraps (low nutrition)
- **🥩 Meat** - Drag to drop fresh meat (more nutritious)
- **🦎 Live Food** - Drag to drop live prey (lizards) that move around - sandkings must hunt them! (best nutrition + reduces hostility)
- **🥓 Treat** - Click to give special treats to a specific colony
- **🕷️ Spider** - Drag to place a deadly spider enemy - all colonies will unite to fight it!
- **💦 Spray** - Spray water to annoy colonies
- **👁️ Observe** - Get detailed information about a colony

### Environmental Controls
- **Heat Slider** (0-100°) - Control temperature (higher heat = faster growth & hunger, extreme heat = increased aggression)
- **Humidity Slider** (0-100%) - Control moisture (optimal at ~40%, too dry or wet = stress)

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Four Colonies**: Red, White, Black, Orange - each builds elaborate castles
- **Progressive Growth**: Sandkings grow from 1px to 15px over 365 game days
- **Warfare System**: Hungry/hostile colonies attack each other with visual battles
- **Spider Threat**: All colonies unite against common threat!
- **Sound System**: Population-scaled ambient sounds (can be muted)

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Select tools from the toolbar to interact
3. **Grab tool** - Click on a sandking, hold, and drag to move it
4. **Live Food (🦎)** - Click, hold, and drag into tank (it will move and they hunt it!)
5. Feed colonies to keep them alive and reduce hostility
6. Adjust environmental controls to affect growth and behavior

## Tips

- Live food (🦎) must be **dragged** like other food types - click, hold, and drag it into the tank
- Release a spider to see all colonies temporarily unite
- Use grab tool to relocate sandkings to different areas
- Well-fed colonies carve adoring faces in their castles
